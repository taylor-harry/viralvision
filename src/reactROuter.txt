Static routing is the old way of routing

eg. routes.js routes = <Route path='Home' component{HomeComponent}/>
eg. index.js REACTDOM.render(routes, document.getElementById('app'))

^^ Not a good way to do it, not react like.

Dynamic routing - takes place as your app renders
**everything is a component
